- first introduce NPI and why it is important
- give context: fashion (glasses, shoes, ...)
- 1st issue: Supply Chain people do not own the process
- (2nd issue: different process) regional managers making aggregate estimates by product categories

- acknowledge it is a bit of a provocation but
- context is to have an AutoML tool
- ideally boosted trees are better performance wise (but note that performance is not priority here, see previous slide)
- but: they can forecast stuff outside of ranges (that is something you have to take into account - and you cannot just clip away, you have to redistribute "mass")
- general idea is: resist the hype, sometimes there are reasons
