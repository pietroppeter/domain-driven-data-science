- (1) problem and opportunity
- (2) the domain I know best
- (3) give hints
- mention appendix on DDD/Data Mesh? or it is part one

The aim is to:
- highlight why this is important and undervalued and underexplored
- teach you something about a specific domain
- give some examples of where domain thinking might help
  (and maybe we do it unconsciounsly)
- also trying to be a but more systematic and conscious about the domain component of our work

ultimate hope is to contribute to stimulate more talks about domain issues,
since I want to hear more of them

- Hi I am Pietro and these are my emojis...
- (math) dynamical systems, weather and climate as my first domain (research), later cryptography
- ToolsGroup, 9 years, 200-300 international, 30 yrs old
- (break)
- AgileLab, <1yr, 150-200 consulting in 10 yrs

Motivation for this part is:
- in part credibility in what I say
- but a lot also to put into context of what I say
- and to be clear about limitations about what I say
- (it may or not apply to your case)

My hope in general is that more people do talks about domain expertise
so that we can learn from multiple point of views
