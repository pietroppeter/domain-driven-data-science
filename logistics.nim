- def: Logistics is the process of strategically managing the procurement,
movement and storage of materials, parts and finished inventory
(and related information flows)
- def continues: "...through the organisation and its marketing channels in such a way
  that current and future profitability are maximised through the cost-effective fulfillment of orders"
- logistics is homonym of the logistics curve, comes from French Marechal de Logis, the officer in charge of the functioning of an army
- logistics is now a cornerstone of international trade
