## agenda

3 main parts (domain, logistics, stories)

- intro
  - agenda
  - me
    - math
    - like programming
    - started in data science 10 years ago
    - from product to consulting
    - feelings of province of the empire?
    - PyData!
    - (RC)
  - agilelab
    - italian (starts)
    - core sowftare engineering + agile + innovation
    - elite data engineering
    - data mesh
    - data governance/data platform witboost
    - innovative: public handbook, hola!
- inspiration
  - software engineering
  - domain driven design
    - ubiquitous language
  - data mesh
- domain
  - history
  - venn diagram
  - various roles (DS, DE, DA) DS younger than DE? DA?
  - why important (for more impact/less failures)
  - claim: we have many code/algo resources, far fewer domain resources and less methodology to study a domain
  - data science as a domain
    - B2B vs B2C (vs science/research)
- logistics
  - history
  - supply chain
  - code and math highlights (forecasting, optimization, ml/learning? ...)
  - data science and OR
  - warehouses
  - transportation
- stories
  - why sometimes random forest better than boosting?
  - why they are not using NPI?
  - ... (other stories from TG)
  - story of warehouse project
  - story of optical networks 
- methods
  - write a business and domain essential
  - read domain books
  - establish ubiquitous language (and iterate on it)
    - use it in code! refactor to make sure you are up to date!
  - youtube videos of domain experts (optical fiber)
  - follow people on socials (e.g. OR/SC list)
- conclusions?

## random notes

slide on venn diagram:
- quote the original source
- what is missing? data
- note that industry at the time did not have data engineers (I think): https://x.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1831131865115488490

small data project idea:
- look in towards data science how much domain is represented
- look in curricula for Data Science course how much domain is represented

a discussion of OR versus Data Science is also in order. OR as the science of better decisions seems perfectly in line with DS objectives but it predated the Data Scientists and it is still a somwhat distinct community (they seem to be getting closer).
There might be many reason for this but a new sexy role might be one of them.

a section could be: what domain knowledge can give back to Data Science and should feature:

- genchi genbutsu
- and the 5(?) S


disclaimer: will restrict to Data Science in the business domain (no science)
